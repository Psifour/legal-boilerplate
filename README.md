# legal-boilerplate
A public repository of legal disclaimers and licenses that I use and/or plan to use.

## Informed Consent:

While many businesses use disclaimers to avoid legal liabilities, these will always focus on increasing the knowledge and awareness of end-users. While they may provide *some* legal protection they are not intended as legal advice and should be reviewed by your legal representative if you intend to utilize them in that manner.

My goal is, and hopefully always will be, to increase user awareness, even at the potential cost of the 'facade of perfection' that most developers and corporate entities would rather portray. By focusing on this we enable users/readers/clients to make more informed decisions, including, but not limited to; working with companies/software that respect them, enabling them to consent to risks in a non-evil way, and furthering the education/understanding of all.

## Licensing
